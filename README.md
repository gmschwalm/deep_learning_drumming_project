# deep_learning_drumming_project
The goal of this project will be to train a model to differentiate between 18 different genres of drumming using a MIDI database of 22,000 measures of labeled drumming data (Groove MIDI Dataset). Sequential models are well suited to working with music. Multiple models will be trained to perform the drumming style classification task. The cost, performance, and training process of each model will be examined.

Mar. 2019. “Groove MIDI Dataset,” distributed by Google LLC, Available: 	https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/groove#download 
	The primary database for this project, “composed of 13.6 hours of aligned MIDI and 	(synthesized) audio of human-performed, tempo-aligned expressive drumming. The dataset 	 contains 1,150 MIDI files and over 22,000 measures of drumming.” [3]. Each MIDI/WAV pair 	is labeled with 11 fields.
